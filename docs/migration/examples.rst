Migration examples
==================

There are multiple examples of code written using the old LMS API located in the ``src/examples/legacy`` directory.
Some of them have a (mostly) equivalent version of the same example written with the new SDRDevice API in the ``src/examples`` directory.

Example ``dualRXTX`` written with the new API
---------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/examples/dualRXTX.cpp
  :language: cpp

Example ``dualRXTX`` written with the old API
---------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/examples/legacy/dualRXTX.cpp
  :language: cpp
