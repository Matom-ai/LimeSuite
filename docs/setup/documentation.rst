Documentation generation guide
==============================

This page describes how to generate the Lime Suite NG documentation
(the very thing you're reading right now) on Linux.

Prerequisites
-------------

Components needed to generate the Lime Suite NG documentation:

- `GCC`_
- `CMake`_
- `Python 3.8`_
- `Doxygen`_

Setup
-----

To set up the environment for the documentation generation, you will need to set up a `Python virtual environment (venv)`_.

To set up the environment, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.8 -m venv venv # Create the virtual environment directory
    source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all the required dependencies for the generation

.. note::
    One should run these commands in the ``docs`` directory.

Generation
----------

In the ``docs`` directory, located in the root directory of the repository, while in the venv, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -S .. -B ../build # Generate the make file for the suite.
    make --no-print-directory -C ../build doc # Build Doxygen documentation
    breathe-apidoc --generate class --members --force --output-dir apidoc ../build/xml/ # Generate the class API pages
    python add_undoc_members.py # Add a flag to add all undocumented members into the page
    make html # Generate the documentation itself

.. important::
    These commands or the script must be run in the venv, otherwise it will fail.

For ease of convenience, there is also a ``generate_docs.sh`` script located in the ``docs`` directory.

After a successful generation the resulting documentation pages will be located in
``docs/_build/html`` directory.

Link checking
-------------

To check whether all URLs in the documentation are valid, there exists a ``make`` target to automatically check the links:

.. code-block:: bash

    make checklinks

.. note::
    Run this in the ``docs`` directory while in the venv.

This will check whether all the URLs in the documentation are still valid and open a working webpage.
Any broken links will be shown in red and also listed in the ``_build/linkcheck/output.txt`` file.

Docker
------

There also exists a Docker file to generate the documentation.
To generate this documentation using Docker, in the root directory of the repository run:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -o <output_location> -f GenerateDocumentation.Dockerfile .

This will run the whole documentation generation script and place the generated HTML in the specified directory.
